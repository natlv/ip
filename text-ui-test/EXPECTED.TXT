Hello! I'm Natsbot
What can I do for you?

Type a prompt below, type 'list' to see tasks,
or type 'bye' to exit the program.

You haven't added any tasks to the list yet!
Error: I'm sorry, I don't understand that command. Use 'list' to see tasks, 'bye' to exit, 'todo' to add a todo, 'deadline' to add a deadline, 'event' to add an event, 'mark' to mark a task as done, or 'delete' to delete a task.
Error: The 'event' command must include a description and a time range. Usage: event DESCRIPTION /from START /to END
Error: The description of a todo cannot be empty. Usage: todo DESCRIPTION
