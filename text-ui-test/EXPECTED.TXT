Hello! I'm Natsbot. What can I do for you?
Here's the possible ways you can text me:
 [] denotes required non-empty fields
 > 'todo [task description]' - adds a to-do task
 > 'deadline [task description] /by [due date]' - adds a deadline task
  - The due date should be in the format 'yyyy-MM-dd' or 'yyyy-MM-dd HHmm'
 > 'event [task description] /from [event start] /to [event end]' - adds an event task
 > 'doafter [task description] /after [prerequisite]' - adds a task to be done after something else > 'list' - lists all existing tasks
 > 'mark [task number]' - marks a task as done
 > 'delete [task number]' - deletes a task
 > 'find [keyword]' - finds tasks containing the keyword
 > 'bye' - exits the program

You haven't added any tasks to the list yet!
Hmm... your task list is empty. There's nothing to see here.
Error: I'm sorry, I don't understand that command. Use 'list' to see tasks,'bye' to exit, 'todo' to add a todo, 'deadline' to add a deadline, 'event' to add an event,'do-after' to add a do-after task, 'mark' to mark tasks as done, or 'delete' to delete tasks.
